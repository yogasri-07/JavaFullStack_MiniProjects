Java Full Stack Mini Projects
📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java Full Stack mini projects developed to strengthen understanding of Core Java, JDBC, Servlets, and JSP.
The projects include console-based applications, Servlet-based web applications, and JSP programs, demonstrating database connectivity, servlet lifecycle management, and dynamic web page creation.

These projects are intended for students, beginners, and academic practice.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8+)

JDBC

MySQL

Servlets (Jakarta Servlet API)

JavaServer Pages (JSP)

HTML

Apache Tomcat

Eclipse IDE

📂 Project Modules
1️⃣ Java Console Applications with JDBC

Stores student details (name, roll number, department) into a database.

Bank Account Balance Checker
Retrieves account balance using account number.

Product Price Updater
Updates product price using product ID.

Employee Salary Viewer
Displays employee salary based on employee ID.

2️⃣ Servlets Without JDBC

Addition Calculator Servlet

Simple Interest Calculator

Temperature Converter (Celsius → Fahrenheit)

Username Display Servlet

These projects demonstrate basic HTML–Servlet communication without database usage.

3️⃣ Servlets With JDBC (Lifecycle Methods)

Full Registration & Login System

Library Book Entry and View System

Employee Attendance System

Customer Order Placement System

These applications use:

init() for database connection

service() for business logic

destroy() for resource cleanup

4️⃣ JavaServer Pages (JSP)

JSP Addition Program

JSP Discount Calculator

JSP Student Grade Calculator

JSP Feedback Form

Each JSP project combines HTML and Java logic within a single JSP file.

🗄️ Database

The projects use MySQL databases with tables such as:

students

accounts

products

employees

users

books

orders

Database tables must be created before running the applications.

▶️ How to Run

Install JDK and Apache Tomcat

Import the project into Eclipse

Configure Tomcat Server

Create required MySQL tables

Update database credentials in Java files

Run the application on the server or console

🎯 Learning Outcomes

JDBC CRUD operations

PreparedStatement & ResultSet usage

Servlet lifecycle methods

HTML to Servlet communication

JSP scripting elements

Basic Java web application structure
